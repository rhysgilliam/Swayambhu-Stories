## Workspace

Opening the project will open the Unity editor. To test the model locally, press the play button at the top-middle of the workspace window. You should be able to move around the model (WASD keys) and interact with the lotus flower annotations using the text prompts. If this runs with no compilation errors, the model has initialized correctly!
